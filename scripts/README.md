## Performance Analysis (Coming soon<sup><sub>TM</sub></sup>)

Right now, performance benchmarks are done through taking the current time stamp before we execute a unit of code, and then taking the current time stamp once that code has finished executing. The performance is measured by the difference between those two time stamps.

In the future, it'd be more ideal to use a Node addon for more detailed and performant benchmarking.

I've been messing around with addons a little here and there, so this feature is still on the TODO list.
