Needle is a standalone extensive data structure library in JavaScript.

## Installation

## API Reference

Needle has a variety of different data structures at its disposal. Here is a reference to all of the currently available data structures that Needle supports. Some data structures have not been added yet and they will appear unavailable.

*If you feel that there should be additional data structures added to this library, [send me a message and let me know your ideas.](mailto:zuber.nicholas@gmail.com)*

**Note:** In the API, `*` refers to any type. This is commonly used when specifying the type of data; since all types of data are supported when inserting custom data into a data structure.

### <a href="#singlylinkedlist" name="singlylinkedlist">Needle.SinglyLinkedList()</a>
 - **(constructor)**([< * >data]) - *object* - Creates a Singly Linked List and inserts a node at the head of the newly created list if `data` is given.
 
 - **insertFront**(< * >data) - *void* - Create a node from `data` and inserts at the front of the list.
 
 - **insertNth**(< *number* >index, < * >data) - *boolean* - Create a node from `data` and insert in the location of the linked list specified by `index`.
 
 - **insertAfter**(< * >targetData, < * >data) - *boolean* - Create a node from `data` and insert after the node which has the data specified by `targetData` and returns `true` if the element was successfully added to the linked list.
 
 - **insertBack**(< * >data) - *void* - Create a node from `data` and inserts at the back of the list.
 
 - **remove**(< * >data) - *boolean* - Removes the element specified by `data` and returns `true` if the element was successfully found and removed from the linked list.
 
 - **removeNth**(< *number* >index) - *void* - Removes the element in the location of the linked list specified by `index`.
 
 - **find**(< * >data) - *Node || false* - Finds the element specified by `data` and returns that `Node` if the element was successfully found but returns `false` if the node was not found.
 
 - **findNth**(< *number* >index) - *Node* - Finds the element in the location of the linked list specified by `index` and returns that `Node`.

### <a href="#doublylinkedlist" name="doublylinkedlist">Needle.DoublyLinkedList()</a>
 - **(constructor)**([< * >data]) - *object* - Creates a Doubly Linked List and inserts a node at the head of the newly created list if `data` is given.
 
 - **insertFront**(< * >data) - *void* - Create a node from `data` and inserts at the front of the list.
 
 - **insertNth**(< *number* >index, < * >data) - *boolean* - Create a node from `data` and insert in the location of the linked list specified by `index`.
 
 - **insertAfter**(< * >targetData, < * >data) - *boolean* - Create a node from `data` and insert after the node which has the data specified by `targetData` and returns `true` if the element was successfully added to the linked list.
 
 - **insertBack**(< * >data) - *void* - Create a node from `data` and inserts at the back of the list.
 
 - **remove**(< * >data) - *boolean* - Removes the element specified by `data` and returns `true` if the element was successfully found and removed from the linked list.
 
 - **removeNth**(< *number* >index) - *void* - Removes the element in the location of the linked list specified by `index`.
 
 - **find**(< * >data) - *Node || false* - Finds the element specified by `data` and returns that `Node` if the element was successfully found but returns `false` if the node was not found.
 
 - **findNth**(< *number* >index) - *Node* - Finds the element in the location of the linked list specified by `index` and returns that `Node`.

### <a href="#binaryheap" name="binaryheap">Needle.BinaryHeap()</a>
**Note:** The default `compare` function is defined as
```javascript
function defaultCompare(a, b){
  return (a < b);
}
```
 
 - **(constructor)**([< *function* >compare]) - *object* - Creates a Binary Heap and if a function is passed in, it overrides the default compare function with the function defined by `compare`.
 
 - **peek**() - *element* - Returns the root or top element of the heap.
 
 - **insert**(< * >data) - *void* - Inserts the element given by `data` into the heap and adjusts the heap accordingly.
 
 - **delete**() - *void* - Removes the root or top element from the heap and adjusts the heap accordingly.
