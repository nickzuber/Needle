## Description
Needle is an extensive data structure library in JavaScript. Each data structure is organized in its own module, so specific data structures can be imported to reduce file size.

## Installation
Simply include the jaz production file on your webpage (preferably all webpages).
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/scripts/needle.min.js"></script>
```

## Testing
While Needle by itself is a standalone software, some tools and utilities are used for building and testing purposes. All of the required files are located in the `/test` directory for testing. Any dependencies will already be integrated into the test code, but for reference and documentation they will be listed below:
